Ok so basically all I got done was the boundaries and image processing. The way u use image processing is to take a picture of that image from the region specified in BOUNDARIES.py and add it to whatev directory u want. U then supply that directory to an image monitor object, as well as the ROI (from boundaries) and then just supply the base image and it'll do the rest. Feel free to threshold the similarities how u please.
